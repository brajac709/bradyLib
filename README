This project is mostly to version control my local LaTeX libraries.

MAE.sty: contains many definitions that I tend to use at 
Cornell Mechanical Engineering.  Main features include:
   Center Of Mass shape in Tikz.
   MATLAB and Python listing definitions
   General Formatting consistency

ruina.sty: Contains a few extra definitions for MAE 5730 homeworks that 
Ruina wants.  Namely his specific header

Other files are works in progress
